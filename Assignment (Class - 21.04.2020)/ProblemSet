(2) Discuss the structure of amylopectin in detail with illustrations

(3) What are glycoproteins? Take a protein whose experimental structure is known, discuss the structural features and its functional aspects.

(4) What are sphingolipids?

(5) Why does the composition of types of lipid molecules change with respect to cell type? Take some examples and discuss.
